## Reflection
💭 Working on the Endless Runner project was an engaging and educational experience. The process involved understanding an existing codebase, making meaningful edits, and enhancing the game’s visuals and functionality. Editing materials and UI components was straightforward, but modifying scripts to align with the desired gameplay mechanics posed a significant challenge. Ensuring compatibility with procedural generation logic was particularly demanding.  
One of the most notable challenges was debugging player-controller scripts to maintain smooth responsiveness while avoiding conflicts with dynamic obstacle generation. Additionally, balancing aesthetics and performance required multiple iterations, as high-quality materials sometimes impacted frame rates.  
This project reinforced the importance of structured development workflows, including version control and documentation. Collaborating with an existing project highlighted the need for thorough understanding before implementing changes. Overall, this experience significantly improved my technical and problem-solving skills, leaving me better equipped for future development projects.
